# `Siamese Neural Network`

## What is that?
Siamese networks are typically used for measuring similarity.
This code takes two input images and uses a distance function to compute the degree of similarity between them. 
This approach is commonly used in applications like face recognition, where measuring similarity is important. 
In applications like face recognition, a Siamese network can be used to determine whether two given images belong to the same person or not.

## Local Environment
For the local environment, you can use the pip package manager to automatically install the dependencies in the requirements.txt file.
