# `Siamese Neural Network`

## What is that?
Siamese networks are typically used for measuring similarity.
In this code, it takes two input images and uses a distance function to compute the degree of similarity between these images. 
This approach is commonly used in applications like face recognition, where measuring similarity is important. 
In applications like face recognition, a Siamese network can be used to determine whether two given images belong to the same person or not.
